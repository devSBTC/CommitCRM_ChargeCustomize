This file will give notes on each {%%} in hopes to center where functions are
Or lead to me entirely rewriting everything myself
Sorry if it seems a bit like a science report

Note: {%[***myofficesetting2***]%} and {%[***MyOfficeSettingMobile2***]%}
        are text files that are present, but unneccessary (display purposes only)
    Also the files listed below were searched for within the entire CCRM server,
        but nothing was found :(
        
The sole purpose of this research is to save work
A rewrite seems inevitable, but an attempt to pinpoint certain sources
(mainly CSS files and certain JavaScript functionalities) to save time
and better performance

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method: 
    The work done here is completely meant to improve the functionality of the labor charges
    This is entirely web interface of CommitCRM, 
    So we will only be focusing on the Web Interface server

    Step 1: Open slpedit22501.html in notepad
            since this was the file isolated as the charge page    
    Step 2: Add a unique comment next to the specified {%%}
            Copy the entire file to copyToCompare.html to later check for differences
    Step 3: Comment out the {%%} pair you want with HTML notation (<!-- -->)
            Save the file 
    Step 4: In services, restart "CommitWebInterface"
    Step 5: After it has restarted and says "Running", 
            refresh the page where you have the charges page loaded
            Note: You may need to relogin to get here
                    In that case More->Charges->New Charge->Labor
    Step 6: Observe any immediate changes
            Make sure to open developer tools and look at the code present in elements
            Most important
                CHANGES TO STYLE
                HEADER Missing
                drop down not working
    Step 7: Remove the comment you made, and repeat the process with the next {%%} pair

    Notes are found below
